          You look around to see that there are other floating rocks ahead of you.
          The rock that you are standing on has two bridges connected to other rocks.
          In between the two bridges you see a giant troll dressed like a wizard.
          The troll tells you that if you wish to escape it's realm you must cross three bridges.
          Past each bridge you must answer a question to continue.
          To the left lies the path of mathematics and to the right lies the path of riddles.
          The troll then asks you, which path will you take?</div>
